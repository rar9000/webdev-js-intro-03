Explain why a number data type added to a string data type returns a string.
- Because it concatenates it into a string because you can't add a number and a non-number.

Name a scenario where using the == operator could cause a bug.
- (21 == "21"). A string is not a number. A string such as "21" could be converted to a 1 (boolean) when using ==
  If a string is entered to check for legal drinking age in an app "21" would be rejected as not equal to 21. 

Name the operator(s) that you find confusing and explain why.
- '| |' because it alwasy picks the number on the left.
  Apparaently this is because it evauluates from left to right and picks the 1st true value it encounters. 

Explain a situation where you would use the Modulus operator and why.
- To determine if a number is even or odd. Take the number 5. Is it odd or even?
  5 % 2 would produce "false" output meaning it is not even.
